## Characters
- For now, June's character is named Shark, Camillia's is named Mage, and Jason's is named Rat
- Feel free to change these to your preferred characters' names...
- All three characters are using palette swaps of the Shark sprite as a placeholder
- You can choose your own player for P1, and P2 is fixed for now

## Connecting
- Connecting happens on the character screen
- First, one player should click 's' to be the server
- Second, the other player should click 'c' to be the client
